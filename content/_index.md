## What is CUWiP?

CUWiP is the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics. The goal of APS CUWiP is to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference, information about graduate school and professions in physics, and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences, advice, and ideas. The national and local organizing committees of APS CUWiP strive to create a welcoming environment for all, including undergraduate women and gender minorities.

## The venue

### 

Founded in 1963 to fuel the region’s talent pipeline and support the growing U.S. space program, UCF is built to make a better future for our students and society. It’s one of the reasons U.S. News & World Report ranks UCF among the nation’s top 20 most innovative colleges, while Forbes, Kiplinger and The Princeton Review rank us a best-value university.

As a metropolitan research university in Florida, we are driven to do more and be more. We believe success can only happen when we expand opportunity and demand excellence. We believe if there’s a better way, we should do it. We believe innovation comes from the meeting of diverse viewpoints. And when more people unleash their full potential, anything is possible.
